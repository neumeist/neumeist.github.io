During the CERN pilot beams at the end of October, for the first time CMS has reconstructed online the LHC collision data with Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). At CMS, the High Level Trigger (HLT) is responsible for analysing in real time up to 100â€™000 collision events per second, and selecting the most highly energetic, rare or otherwise interesting ones for permanent storage and offline analysis. The CMS experiment is one of the largest international scientific collaborations in history, involving more than 4000 scientists, engineers, and students from 206 institutes in 47 countries, including Purdue University's Department of Physics and Astronomy.
