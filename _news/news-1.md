The new CMS result on searches for new physics in high mass dilepton events is now public.
Our group played a leading role in the research documented in this publication.
Especially Jan-Frederik Schulte and Minxi Yang signifanctly contributed to this analysis!
3 years of work that can finally be shared with the world.

CMS has recently released a new paper that pushes far into the unexplored high mass region of pairs of very energetic electrons or muons, in the hopes of discovering new particles or forces.
