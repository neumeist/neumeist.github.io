The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) Collaboration at CERN, which includes significant contributions from Purdue University physicists, has been awarded the 2025 Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics for its groundbreaking work at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in Geneva, Switzerland.

Dubbed the "Oscars of Science," the Breakthrough Prizes honor transformative achievements in the fields of Fundamental Physics, Life Sciences, and Mathematics. The award honors the collaboration’s detailed measurements of Higgs boson properties confirming the symmetry-breaking mechanism of mass generation, the discovery of new strongly interacting particles, the study of rare processes and matter-antimatter asymmetry, and the exploration of nature at the shortest distances and most extreme conditions at CERN’s LHC.

Purdue University, a founding member of the CMS Collaboration, has played a vital role in this achievement. Six faculty members from Purdue’s Department of Physics and Astronomy are currently active in CMS research: Norbert Neumeister, Andreas Jung, Matthew Jones, Mia Liu, Fuqiang Wang, and Wei Xie.
