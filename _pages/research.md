My research falls into two main areas: understanding elementary particles and their interactions at the most fundamental level.
My interest in physics also informs
projects on .
My other main research agenda uses advanced methods to develop ....
One project uses Bayesian item response theory to measure the
strength of peace agreements as a latent variable and free researchers from
post-treatment bias caused by using the duration of agreements as a proxy for
their strength. In others, I apply unsupervised learning techniques to over a
billion observations of product-level international trade data to measure
economic interdependence and illicit economic exchange.

In a new avenue of research, I leverage on Machine Learning data to explore.

My research is funded by the [Department of Energy Office of Science](https://www.energy.gov/science/office-science), the [National Science Foundation](https://nsf.gov) and the [Purdue Research Foundation](http://prf.org).

 I amleading a coherent program of precision measurements and discovery at the energy frontier with the CMS experiment at the [Large Hadron Collider](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) at [CERN](https://www.cern.ch). He have been a member of the [CMS collaboration](https://cms.cern) since the early design phase, joining in 1993 and had major roles in developing a number of essential physics tools and methods necessary from the collisions to the final analysis. My group plays a leading role at every step needed to assure the success of the CMS physics program from detector operation, data quality monitoring, data analysis and the development of new software tools to continue improving the performance of CMS. During the time from the anticipated LHC start-up in 2007 to the first data taking, I worked on the detailed understanding of the detector and on the physics commissioning of the detector with cosmic muons. After the LHC start-up I worked on the first measurement of the Z cross section, the differential and double differential Drell-Yan cross section, the search for high-mass resonances in the dimuon channel and on same-sign dilepton SUSY searches. His physics focus at Run 2 has been on searches for new physics using events with two or more leptons (electrons or muons) in the final state and on the H→μμ analysis to measure the coupling to the second-generation fermions. This is also motivated by his interest and expertise in muon reconstruction and triggering.

For many years my group has played a major role in the development of muon reconstruction and selection software in the CMS experiment. From 2005-2006 he was convener of the CMS Muon Physics Reconstruction and Selection (PRS) project. In 2007  I was the coordinator of the CMS Muon Physics Object Group. He has been playing a key role in the CMS muon High-Level Trigger project and made fundamental contributions to the analysis, triggering, reconstruction and identification of muons.  Under his leadership a novel muon trigger, that significantly improves the muon trigger efficiency, has been developed and deployed. In addition, he developed high-performance muon reconstruction algorithms combining the measurements in the muon chambers and the silicon tracker, resulting in efficient and accurate identification of muons and the reconstruction of their momenta with high precision over a large range of muon energies, which is crucial for all physics analyses involving muons in the final state. My interdisciplinary computing effort resulted in the largest CMS Tier-2 analysis center, which enables and supports important physics analyses.


The LHC is currently the only operating collider to probe in detail the TeV energy scale relevant to electroweak symmetry breaking and to search for new physics phenomena not predicted by the Standard Model. It is a 17-mile long accelerator considered to be the largest scientific instrument on the planet and its physics program will continue for at least another 10 years. 
The LHC  began its operation in 2010 with proton-proton collisions at 7 TeV. In 2012 the energy was increased to 8 TeV and in Summer 2012 the discovery of the Higgs particle was announced -- a major scientific discovery. Then the machine was undergoing maintenance and consolidation work to increase its energy by a factor of 2, which in turn increased its capability to search for new particles. From 2015 to 2018 the LHC has provided proton-proton collisions at 13 TeV and delivered an unprecedented data set which opened novel possibilities for searches for new physics, precision measurements such as the properties of the Higgs boson, as well as detailed studies of the flavor sector. At the end of 2018, it entered a two-year shutdown period for further upgrades. The goal of the upgrades is to implement the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) project, that will increase the luminosity by a factor of 10.  The LHC is projected to restart in 2022 and will run until the end of 2024. The HL-LHC is scheduled to come into operation in 2028.

- **Search for new heavy neutral vector bosons, contact interactions, extra dimensions and dark matter using di-muon events:**
: New heavy neutral gauge bosons (Z<sup>'</sup>) are predicted in extensions of the Standard Model. There are many options for this extra gauge symmetry including Grand Unified Theory (GUTs), Randall-Sundrum graviton models and Kaluza-Klein excitation of extra dimensions. Since the very beginning I have been involved in the search for high-mass resonances in the dimuon channel (Z<sup>'</sup>&rarr;&mu;&mu;). Together with my students and postdocs I have been working on many important aspects of the search for high-mass resonances in the dimuon channel and published the most precise determination of the di-muon mass spectrum up to the highest masses ever achieved. This result has provided the most sensitive limits on new high-mass particles.  This search has been one of the flagship analyses of the LHC physics program. In addition to the search for high-mass resonances in we have been working on searches for a non-resonant dilepton excess in the context of contact interactions and large extra dimensions.  Furthermore, my group has been working on additional interpretations of the limits set for a high mass dilepton resonance in the context of dark matter mediators and pioneered a new analysis searching for leptophobic Z<sup>'</sup> bosons decaying into four-lepton final states. This baryonic gauge boson is well motivated in a supersymmetry framework and greatly increased sensitivity for new discoveries.

- **Search for lepton flavor universality (LFU) violation:**
One of the fundamental predictions of the Standard Model is Lepton Flavour Universality. Any deviation from this prediction would indicate the existence of physics beyond the Standard Model. Recent LHCb measurements present a pattern of deviations from this prediction in rare B-meson decays.
: Hints for lepton flavor universality (LFU) violation in several measurements recently reported by the LHCb Collaboration have sparked interest in models for physics beyond the SM that could explain these effects, such as heavy neutral gauge bosons or leptoquarks. Some of these models would result in a significant deviation from unity of the ratio of the dimuon to dielectron differential cross section as a function of dilepton mass. To search for signs of LFU violation at high dilepton mass we spearheaded a new analysis, where the ratio of the differential dilepton production cross sections in the muon and electron channels is measured as a function of dilepton mass. This is the first measurement of this kind at the LHC and the results have been recently published.

- **Measurement of the Higgs boson properties (coupling to the second-generation fermions); H &rarr; &mu;&mu;:**
: Since 2016 my group has been working on the Higgs to two muon decay analysis to measure the coupling of the Higgs boson to the second-generation fermions. After the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, the measurement of its properties is of paramount importance. Since so far only couplings to the third-generation fermions have been observed it is important to show that the Higgs boson also couples to second-generation fermions. The H→μμ channel has a clean final-state signature and it is the only channel where the Higgs coupling to second-generation fermions can be measured at the LHC. The challenge is to search for a narrow mass peak on a smooth background that is dominated by the irreducible Drell-Yan tail above the Z boson resonance. Since the kinematic properties of the signal and the main background are very similar in this analysis, advanced machine-learning techniques are needed, and we developed new deep learning techniques to optimize the signal extraction. In September 2020, the CMS Collaboration published a paper reporting the first evidence of a Higgs boson decaying to a pair of oppositely charged muons. An excess of events over the expected background was reported, with a statistical significance of 3σ, and the measured signal strength has been found to be in agreement with the Standard Model predictions. This result is an important milestone in Higgs physics, as it provides the first statistically significant measurement of the Higgs boson coupling to second generation fermions. Our  group significantly contributed to this result, specifically in the gluon-gluon fusion (ggH) and the vector boson fusion (VBF) production channels where new ways to optimally take the dimuon mass resolution into account were explored and the input features and hyperparameters of MVA discriminants that are used to improve the separation between signal and background events were optimization. The H→μμ analysis will remain one of our main analysis goals during Run 3 of the LHC that is scheduled to start in 2022.

- **Design and development of High-Level Trigger algorithms for Run 3 and the HL-LHC:**
: For Run 2 we developed a new Level-3 muon trigger that is be able to better cope with the high-energy and high-luminosity conditions. An evolution of this trigger will be deployed for Run 3.

decays of the Higgs boson into a pair of muons. The framework implements all analysis steps and therefore can serve
as an example of a typical HEP analysis for benchmarking various processing methods and
workflows.
In the framework development, we pursue two main objectives. Firstly, to implement data
processing in a way that accelerates both development and performance by using a columnar
approach (via coffea, awkward-array). Secondly, to distribute the computations across a
local Analysis Facility using custom Dask workflows in a way that efficiently utilizes available
computing resources.
