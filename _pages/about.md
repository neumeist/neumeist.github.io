My area of research is in experimental Particle Physics where we use accelerators to search for new particles and
study the properties of the elementary constituents of matter and their interactions at the most fundamental level. I am
currently involved in the [Compact Muon Solenoid](https://cms.cern) (CMS) experiment at the 
[Large Hadron Collider](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) at [CERN](http://www.cern.ch)
 and my research is focused on understanding
the mechanism by which the symmetry between the electromagnetic and weak interaction is broken, the search for
new physics beyond the established Standard Model, the understanding of the structure of the proton and large-scale
distributed data analysis.

The [CMS experiment](https://cms.cern) is one of the two general-purpose experiments at the [Large Hadron Collider](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) at [CERN](http://www.cern.ch),
designed to study the physics of proton-proton collisions. It involves more than 3000 scientists and engineers from
more than 220 institutes and 50 countries. It is believed that the unprecedented energy range and sensitivity of the
LHC, combined with the special capabilities of the CMS experiment will lead to a breakthrough in our understanding
of nature. Prior to joining Purdue, I worked on the CMS Level-1 trigger, the search for supersymmetric particles, as
well as for rare B-meson decays within the [DELPHI experiment](https://home.cern/science/experiments/delphi) at the [Large Electron Positron](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-electron-positron-collider) (LEP) collider and on
Bose-Einstein correlation studies within the [UA1 experiment](https://home.cern/science/experiments/ua1).

Understanding the elementary constituents of matter and the fundamental forces that control their behavior at the most
basic level is the primary goal of particle physics. For the past 50 years, the current theory of particles and fields,
known as the [Standard Model of Particle Physics](https://www.energy.gov/science/doe-explainsthe-standard-model-particle-physics), has been unexpectedly successful in describing with high precision the results of the
great majority of particle physics experiments. The Standard Model mechanism of spontaneous electroweak symmetry
breaking requires the existence of a neutral scalar particle, the Higgs boson. The Standard Model predicts the Higgs
boson couplings to all other particles of known mass, but its mass remains unspecified. In the summer of 2012 the
ATLAS and CMS collaborations discovered a new particle with a mass of 125 GeV via decays to photon, W and Z
boson pairs with rates consistent with those of the Standard Model Higgs boson. It is the last piece in the Standard
Model jigsaw-puzzle of the elementary building blocks of matter and their interactions via forces of nature.
